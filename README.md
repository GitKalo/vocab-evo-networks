# Vocabulary evolution on complex networks

This project defines an **agent-based simulation** for exploring the effects of complex social structure on the emergence of vocabulary (in the form of lexical convention) in a structured population of linguistic agents. It is based on an evolutionary model based on Nowak's Evolutionary Language Game and defined by the authors in Ref. [1].

Research based on this model has been published and presented at the *Complex Networks & Their Applications 2021* conference [1]. The model was originally prosposed as part of a final-year Individual Project (COMP3200) at the University of Southampton.

## Running simulations

## Authors

All software was written by **Kaloyan Danovski** (kd1u18[at]southamptonalumni[dot]co[dot]uk). The model is developed and explored by **Kaloyan Danovski** and **Markus Brede**.
